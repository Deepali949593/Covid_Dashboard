Absolutely! Below is your **personalized `README.md`** for your own **COVID-19 Dashboard project**, structured cleanly like your grocery app, with:

* Proper folder structure
* Image sections (with code to embed screenshots)
* Local run instructions
* No Streamlit Cloud (since MongoDB isn’t public)

You can just **replace the screenshot images** inside your `/images/` folder.

# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Dashboard

This is a live **COVID-19 data dashboard** built using:

- 📊 **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit (runs locally)
- ⚙️ **Backend**: Python (requests + data cleaning)
- 🗄️ **Database**: MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- 📈 **Visualization**: Plotly

The app fetches real-time COVID-19 data from a public API, stores it in MongoDB, and displays it through dynamic interactive visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fetch & store data using [disease.sh API](https://disease.sh/)
- Save and update documents in MongoDB
- View country-level statistics
- Plot total cases, recoveries, and deaths
- Trend analysis with interactive graphs
- Dashboard runs fully offline after data storage
